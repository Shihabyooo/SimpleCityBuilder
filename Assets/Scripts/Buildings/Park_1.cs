        //Ditto to happiness boost, which is stored as a fixed value (with a public getter), and polled by each citizen's happiness update loop (in population manager).

    //TODO add a a limit to how many parks we can have (32 or 64), tracked in buildings manager and have button disabled when limit reached (or a message when attempting to
    //construct a new park after limit).
    //Then, have a GridLayer<uint> (or GridLayer<ulong> for 64 limit) each encoding which parks the said cell are serviced with, using bitwise ops.
    //This, of course, means that each park should have an ID of 2^n, n from 0 to 32 (or 64). Buildings manager also needs to keep track of IDs used (could also use bitwise 
    //ops and masks), OR'ing in an ID when a park constructed and assigned the said ID, and AND'ing it out when destroyed/removed.

    //Try to make this system as modular and generic as possible, might convert other buildings/services to follow the same patterns.
